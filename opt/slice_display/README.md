# Slice Display

## Overview

Slice Display is a MATLAB toolbox for visualizing fMRI data, including dual-coded images (simultaneous display of contrast estimate and unthreshold t-statistic maps).

## Getting started

### Requirements

* [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com)
* [MATLAB Statistics Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/products/statistics/)
* [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) by the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at UCL
* [Panel](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20003-panel) by Ben Mitch

### Intstallation

You can either download the code as a ZIP file or you can clone the code:

To download the code:
1. Go to the [Slice Display repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bramzandbelt/slice_display).
2. Select 'Download ZIP' from the green 'Clone or download' button.

To clone the code, run the following command on the command line (require Git to be installed):

```
git clone https://github.com/bramzandbelt/slice_display.git
```

### Usage

See the example scripts in the directory 'examples'.
