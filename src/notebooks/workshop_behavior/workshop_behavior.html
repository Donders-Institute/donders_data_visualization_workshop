    <p class="w3-justify">Figures play a central role in the communication of research findings from scientific studies. Therefore, it is important that they accurately represent the underlying data. However, visualizations can be misleading and graphical design choices can bias perceptions (e.g. check out
      <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2017/02/09/how-to-spot-visualization-lies/" target="_blank">this blogpost from Flowing Data</a>
       ). This workshop aims to promote critical thinking about visualizing
      scientific data and provides you with tools and advise that will help you make
      better figures. More specifically, you will:</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">EVALUATING FIGURES</h2>
    <!-- <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love music</i></p> -->
    <p class="w3-justify">A 2012 survey of 1451 figures from 288 studies in top neuroscience journals found that scientific figures are often unclear and incomplete (Allen et al., 2012). This survey categorized each figure as 2D (e.g. bar, scatter, and line graphs) or 3D (e.g. fMRI statistical maps, time-frequency plots) and asked four questions:</p>
      <div align="left">
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Is the dependent variable labeled?</li>
            <li>Is the scale of the dependent variable indicated?</li>
            <li>Where applicable, is a measure of uncertainty displayed?</li>
            <li>Is the type of uncertainty (e.g. standard error of the mean) defined in the figure or legend?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        The figure below shows the survey's results: as compared to displays of 2D data, visualizations of
        3D data often lack labels and rarely depict measures of uncertainty.

          Expectations about task context facilitate decision making (A) response time (RT) on correct decisions increased as a function of log(CPE). (B) RTs were similar on trials with congruent and incongruent stimuli, and there was no evidence that the relationship between RT and log(CPE) changed as a function of stimulus congruency. (C) Presenting the context cue early both decreased RTs on average and moderated the relationship between RT and log(CPE). (D) The relationship between RT and log(CPE) remained significant when restricting analysis to trials where the context repeated from the previous trial, but context switches moderated the effect of log(CPE). In all panels, error bars show within-subject 95% confidence intervals computed by multilevel bootstrap resampling after removing between-subject variance in median RT.

  <h2 class="w3-wide">WHY VISUALIZE ANYWAY?</h2>
  <!-- <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love music</i></p> -->
  <p class="w3-justify">In addition to communicating research findings, another purpose of data visualization is to guide data exploration. A common data analysis mistake is to skip data exploration and to immediately perform statistical tests and look of statistical significance. This happens especially when automated software and processing pipelines are in place. However, it is essential to visually inspect your data first, as it will help you to:
  </p>
    <div align="left">
      <ul>
          <li>understand broad features of the data;</li>
          <li>inspect the qualitative features of the data;</li>
          <li>discover new or unexpected patterns in the data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="w3-justify">
      To illustrate the importance of data visualization in exploratory analysis, you will analyze a dataset known as Anscombe's quartet using a matlab visualization toolbox called <a href="https://github.com/piermorel/gramm" target="_blank">gramm</a>, which is inspired by Hadley Wickham's R library,
      <a href="http://ggplot2.org/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>, which in turn was inspired by Leland Wilkinson's book The Grammar of Graphics.
    </p>

    <h3> Anscombe's quartet</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
      Anscombe's quartet consists of four sets of x-y pairs. As you will see, descriptive statistics and statistical testing appears to suggest that these four sets are extremely similar, if not identical. However, simply plotting the data reveals that they are very different and that some of them violate the assumptions underlying the statistical tests employed.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">
      Before working with Anscombe's quartet dataset, run the following code to ensure access to the data and required toolboxes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">DESIGN: GRAPHICAL PERCEPTION</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">
  The very same dataset can be visualized in many ways (for a nice example, see
  <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/" target="_blank">this blogpost from Flowing Data</a>
  or

The questions in the checklist above are useful to consider when designing your scientific figures. In addition, you may want to take the perceptual capacities of your readers into account, because not all of the representations are easy to interpret. Research in this regard, which quite literally spans over a century now, has shown that certain graphical representations result in better perceptual decoding, and hence in easier recognition of patterns and better understanding of data. The following exercises are based on <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2681528" target="_blank">Haemer, 1947</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/handbook-of-psychophysiology/EACAC4007D68C77D20B912D18C78A370" target="_blank">Allen & Erhardt (2017)</a></p>

  <h3> Decoding information from graphs: visual attributes </h3>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Data visualizations communicate numbers in terms of visual attributes (e.g. color, shape, size) of geometric objects (e.g. bars, lines, points). Communication is effective only if the reader is able to perceptually decode the information. Information stored in graphs can be decoded through several visual operations, or 'elementary perceptual tasks'. For example, judging the shade of a color, judging the volume or area of an object, or judging the position of a point along a common scale. As it turns out, decoding efficiency and accuracy differs between elementary perceptual tasks.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify w3-example">
    <b>EXERCISE 3</b> </br>
    In groups of 2 or three, try to recognise some of the advantages and disadvantages of a few graphical representations. The following figure plots the same seven values (across rows) using six different visual attributes (across columns). Can you sort the rows by magnitude?
  </p>

  <pre align="left" class="w3-code">

  </pre>

  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center">
    <img src="images/visual_attributes_case1.png" width="100%">
  </div>
  <p class="w3-justify">
  The correct ordering is C, G, E, B, F, A, D. You may have experienced that sorting is more efficient and accurate for attributes on the right as compared to attributes on the left. Indeed, experiments by William Cleveland and Robert McGill in the 1980s showed that the above elementary perceptual tasks can be ordered as followed (from most to least accurate):</p>

    <ol align="left">
      <li>Position along a common scale</li>
      <li>Length and angle</li>
      <li>Area</li>
      <li>Volume</li>
      <li>Color saturation</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Decoding information from graphs: difference between curves</h3>

  <p class="w3-justify">
  You should also take into account perceptual limitations when visually comparing curves. The following figure plots three panels with two curves each. </p>

  <p class="w3-justify w3-example">
    <b>EXERCISE 4</b> </br>
    Can you determine how the difference between curves evolves as a function of x (e.g. increase/deccrease linearly or exponentially, or remains constant)? Do make predictions before finding out the answers.
  </p>

  <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
    graphical_perception('decoding_differences')
  </pre>

  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center">
    <img src="images/visual_attributes_case2.png" width="100%">
  </div>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    The correct answers are: difference remains constants (left panel), difference increases linearly (middle panel), and difference increases exponentially. If you are surprised by the answers, consider the following. To determine the difference between curves, we must judge the vertical distance between them. However, our brains tend to judge the minimum distance between the curves, rather than the vertical distance. <b>The upshot is that if the difference between curves is of interest, then plot this directly.</b>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">VISUALIZING LOW-DIMENSIONAL DATA</h2>
    <h3>Show more, hide less</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Well, show as much as possible, at least. While Anscombe’s quartet is a great example to argue for showing all data, the biggest opposition comes in the form of it being too much information. Barplots, for example, are widely used for their simplicity. They tell a story that’s easy to understand and compare, one may say. Let’s consider an example from Allen et al., (2012). </p>

    <p class="w3-justify w3-example">
      <b>EXERCISE 5</b> </br>
      Here is a dataset of 50 samples responses, collected under conditions 1, 2, and 3. Visualize this dataset using simple plots and infer as much information as possible, and make predictions about the dataset - about the relation between responses and the conditions as we go along.
    </p>

    <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
      % Make data similar to Fig.2 Allen et al (2012)
      data_simple = make_simple_plot_data;

      % Visualize Allen et al (2012) Fig.2 - bar plot
      simple_plot('barplot', data_dir);
    </pre>

    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center">
      <img src="images/simple_barplot.png" width="50%">
    </div>

    <p class="w3-justify">In this figure, bar plot displays the sample mean and standard error (in other cases, it might be standard deviation). Such plots are -</p>
      <ul align="left">
        <li>easy to generate and comprehend; </li>
        <li>can efficiently contrast a large number of conditions in a small  space; </li>
        <li>effective for displaying frequencies or proportions</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="w3-justify">
      However, bar plots are not without problems. They reveal very little about the distribution of data and can therefore be misleading (for a great example and funny initiative, see the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1474588473/barbarplots" target="_blank">#barbarplots Kickstarter project</a>). In fact, bar plots are only suitable for visualizing a set of counts or proportions (e.g. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n2/full/nmeth.2813.html" target="_blank">Krzywinski & Altman, 2014</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="w3-justify">
      The bar graph appears to suggest that the conditions have a similar effect on the response variable.
    </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">
      Now, visualise the same data using box plot
    </p>

    <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
      % Visualize Allen et al (2012) Fig.2 - box plot
      simple_plot('boxplot', data_dir);
    </pre>

    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center">
      <img src="images/simple_boxplot.png" width="50%">
    </div>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Clearly, box plots provide a richer view of the data:
  </p>
    <ul align="left">
      <li>the line inside the box displays the <b>median</b></li>
      <li>the bottom and top of the box show the <b>first and third quartiles</b></li>
      <li>the whiskers show <b>the lowest and highest data point still within 1.5 IQR of the lower and higher quartiles</b>, respectively;</li>
      <li>the dots show <b>outlying values</b> (i.e. beyond 1.5 times the interquartile range), if any.</li>
    </ul>
  <p class="w3-justify">
  Furthermore, notice that this figure now shows the range of the data and that <b>the response values could take both positive and negative values!</b> Such information is hidden from your reader if you only plot the means.</p>

  <p class="w3-justify">
  Now, let's visualize the same data again with a violin plot with superimposed the actual data points.</p>
    <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
      % Visualize Allen et al (2012) Fig.2 - violin plot
      simple_plot('violinplot', data_dir);
    </pre>

    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center">
      <img src="images/simple_violinplot.png" width="50%">
    </div>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Violin plot shows smooth histograms of the dataset, which provide information about the distribution of responses. While it is absolutely true that the means across the three conditions do not change much, with the violin plot, we would not conclude that condition has no effect on the response. <b>The violin plot reveals differences in distributions across the three conditions and suggests that assumption of normality (required for parameteric analyses such as ANOVA) is violated under conditions 2 and 3</b>: under condition 2 the distribution is heavy-tailed, whereas under condition 3 it is bimodal. Advantages of using such a plot are - </p>
    <ul align="left">
      <li>full shape of distribution is visualized</li>
      <li>can also overlay descriptive statistics</li>
      <li>every data point can be displayed (in case of
        bean plots)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="w3-justify">
      If you prefer not to provide all of the data points, but just the distribution, it might be worthwhile to see if you can embed a box plot inside a violin plot. </p>

  <h2 class="w3-wide">CASE STUDY</h2>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Holding on to an arbitrary <i>P</i> < 0.05 cut-off and plotting the same in a bargraph almost certainly hides the rich pattern that your dataset might have. But here are a few questions from Rousselet et al., (2016) that will help you guide your approach to making group-level comparisons:
  </p>

  <ol align="left">
    <li>How many participants show an effect in the same direction as the group? It is possible to get significant group effects with few individual participants showing a significant effect themselves. Actually, with large enough sample sizes, you can pretty much guarantee significant group effects (Wagenmakers, 2007).</li>
    <li>How many participants show no effect, or an effect in the opposite direction to that of the group?</li>
    <li>Is there a smooth continuum of effects across participants, or can we identify subclusters of participants who appear to behave differently from the rest?</li>
    <li>How large are the individual results?</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Let's now consider a typical experiment (example from Rousselet et al., (2016)), in which two groups of participants were tested in two conditions.
  </p>

  <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
    % First import necessary data
    full_filename = fullfile(which('data_rousselet.mat'));
    load(full_filename);
  </pre>

  <p class="w3-justify">
    Now, let's start exploring this dataset. Make a bar plot.
  </p>
  <pre align="left" class="w3-code">
    % Plot bar graph
    rousselet_plot(data,'barplot');
  </pre>

      An ANOVA on these data reveals a significant Group × Condition interaction (<i>F</i><sub>1,20</sub> = 8.345, <i>P</i> = 0.0091). Follow-up paired <i>t</i>-tests reveal a significant condition effect in group 1 (<i>t</i>(10) = 3.87, <i>P</i> = 0.003, difference = 1.24, difference's 95% confidence interval = [0.53, 1.95]), but not in group 2 (<i>t</i>(10) = 0.11, <i>P</i> = 0.92, difference = −0.03 [−0.71, 0.64]).
    </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">
      With these results one might be tempted to conclude that group 1 is sensitive to the experimental manipulation and group 2 is not. Now try a box plot and see if you gain more information out of it.

  The data show large individual differences and overlap between the two groups. In group 2, except for two potential outliers showing large negative effects, the remaining observations are within the range observed for group 1. Six participants from group 2 have differences suggesting an effect in the same direction as group 1, two are near zero, and three go in the opposite direction. So, clearly, the lack of a significant difference between conditions in group 2 is not supported by the data: yes, group 2 has overall smaller differences than group 1, but if group 1 is used as a control group, then most participants in group 2 appear to have effects similar to those of controls. Or so it seems, until we explore the nature of the difference scores by visualizing paired observations in each group

  <p class="w3-justify">
  In group 1, as already observed, results in condition 2 are overall larger than in condition 1. In addition, participants with larger scores in condition 1 tend to have proportionally larger differences between conditions 1 and 2. Such relationship seems to be absent in group 2, which suggests that the two groups differ not only in the overall sensitivity to the experimental manipulation, but that other factors could be at play in group 1 and not in group 2. Thus, the group differences might actually be much more subtle than suggested by our first analyses.

<p class="w3-justify">
  The group dichotomy is easier to appreciate in Fig. 1D, which shows a scatterplot of the paired observations for the two groups. In group 1, the majority of paired observations are above the unity line, demonstrating an overall group effect; there is also a positive relationship between the scores in condition 2 and the scores in condition 1. Again, no such relationship seems to be present in group 2. In particular, the two larger negative scores in group 2 are not associated with participants who scored particularly high or low in condition 1, giving us no clue as to the origin of these seemingly outlier scores.
